# Stellar-Abberation-KSP-2.0
In our high school we all have come across rain problems or wind problems which involve calculating the effects of relative velocity of rain or wind wrt to an observer moving relative to them.Ever wondered such phenomena can also be possible with light rays? Although the effects won't be visible because normally the velocities we experience are very less than speed of light. But in certain cases the effects of relative velocity of light are indeed observabe.For example take the case of light coming from very distant stars. Now the velocity of earth around its orbit can be roughly assumed to be 30 km/s ,which is quite high but still 0.0001 times the speed of light  but with precise enough measurements we can observe these effects. Since the direction of velocity of earth also keeps on changing as it goes around its orbit the direction of relative velocity keeps on changing and thus the position of the faraway star also appears to be changing.This effect known as `Stellar Aberration' was first observed in 1725 by an english astronomer James Bradley.
